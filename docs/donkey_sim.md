# Donkey Simulator

The guide for the simulator is [here](http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/simulator/).
The simulator is downloaded and unzipped as a linux binary.
It can be run in different simulated environments and controlled manually, through pid, or nn.
When run the camera and command data can be logged.
If there is a `log/` folder in the simulator directory, which there is by default, the images and command json will be placed there.
